        <p class="variant">Square Inc. is a financial service and mobile payment company that was launched in 2010
            in response to smaller merchants losing their business over not being able to process card payments
            easily. With more than 15 different tools that enable
            smooth business transactions, Square’s new goal is to empower small businesses by growing their presence
            online.

        <h6>UX Process</h6>
        <p>Keeping the end-users at the center of our design process, we worked closely with Square’s Product Team
            for a period of 4 months (16 weeks) to create an innovative solution that was tailored to the user’s
            needs.

        <h6>User Research</h6>
        <h6><span>Identifying Users</span></h6>
        <p>With a clear understanding of our problem space, we soon discovered that even though our goal was to
            empower small business owners, there was another set of user group which we had to take into
            consideration, namely, their end customers. Hence,
            our <mark>design space had to take into consideration both these user groups - Merchants and their end
                Customers.</mark></p>

        <h6><span>Interviewing Merchants</span></h6>
        <p>Once the two groups of users were identified, we started with the recruitment of participants for our
            study. For this, <mark>we approached several business owners who were willing to share the
                stories</mark> behind starting and running their business with us. We recruited 8 merchants who
            owned a variety of businesses, including jewelry, grooming, dairy, food, and stationery products. Our
            objective was <mark>to identify their general
                business practices and know their
                opinions on online business.</mark> A list of sample questions that we asked them during the
            interview is included below.

        <h6><span>Surveying Customers</span></h6>
        <p>While interviewing the merchants provided us with helpful insights, we also had to learn about the buying
            experiences of their customers. Since we wanted to reach out to a wider group of users, we published a
            survey that would help us collect
            quantitative data. Through these responses, we wanted to <mark>learn about the behavior of customers
                regarding their online shopping practices and preferences.</mark> A list of sample questions from
            the survey is included below.

        <h6><span>Competitor Analysis</span></h6>
        <p>Doing competitor analysis allowed us to understand existing online business solutions. It allowed us to
            get into the shoes of merchants who have experiences with these platforms and understand the merits and
            demerits of each from their perspective.
            For instance, <mark>Facebook store provides merchants with different page templates that best suits
                their
                business. Instagram, on the other hand, allows only verified businesses to sell their products
                online through their app.</mark>

        <p class="para-text">Understanding the needs and the existing pain points from the merchants and the
            customers gave us a good idea of the problems that our design solution should tackle. We analyzed the
            findings and came up with the following design implications.

        <h6>Design</h6>
        <h6><span>Divergent Design Ideas</span></h6>
        <p>Translating our research findings to design, we <mark>brainstormed ideas that focused on communication
                between merchants and customers</mark> as interacting with customers formed an essential part of
            their business. We decided to focus on
            the messaging aspect of selling products on social media and <mark>leveraging the power of messaging by
                making it interactive</mark>. We created three divergent design ideas and listed out the strengths
            and weaknesses of each.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
            <div class="note-dash"></div>
            <div class="note-content">
                Divergent design ideas
                <a href="../assets/files/Square_DivergentDesigns.pdf" target="_blank" class="note-link">[here]</a>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>We proposed these design ideas to our business partner, Square. They were on board with the idea of
            focusing on the interactive messaging idea but <mark>suggested us to introduce chatbots in interactive
                messaging</mark> to take it even one
            more step further. This idea immediately clicked with us as now we had the means to completely automate
            the interaction with the customers that also made inventory and order management an easier task for the
            merchant.
        </p>

        <h6><span>Model Design</span></h6>
        <p>Having a clearer idea of what we wanted to design, we designed this <mark>model that explains how our
                design solution will fit in the business space and what changes this will bring</mark> to existing
            business practices.</p>
        <div class="model">
            <img src="../assets/images/square_model.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>We designed a new app, <mark>Square for Business, that helps merchants run and manage their growing
                business across multiple channels.</mark> <br><br>This app is only merchant facing and hence
            <mark>it does not interfere with the shopping
                experience of the customers.</mark> The customers still shop through their preferred channel with
            the only difference being that the messages are now interactive which is useful for inventory and order
            management.</p>


        <h6><span>Merchant Facing Design</span></h6>
        <p>For the merchant side, I designed the high-fidelity prototype of the Square for Business app. <mark>This
                new app enables the merchant to post products on multiple social media and messaging channels,
                manage product inventory and keep track of customer orders.</mark> In addition to this, our design
            solution allows merchants to keep track of their overall business goals.
        </p>

        <ul class="high-fidelity">
            <li>
                <h2>Create Product</h2>

                <img src="../assets/images/square_customers.jpg">
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h6><span>Customer Facing Design</span></h6>
        <p>For the customer side, I designed <mark>a high-fidelity prototype that depicts the experience of a
                customer with interactive messaging when purchasing through social media platforms.</mark>
            The customer side of interaction has a linear
            flow - from browsing products, placing an order to viewing order details. This interactive messaging
            service can be implemented on any channel that supports direct messaging. We imagined what it would look
            like for a customer on Instagram.
        </p>

        <ul class="high-fidelity">
            <li>

        <h6>Evaluation</h6>
        <p class="evaluation-text">To evaluate the merchant-facing design, we conducted cognitive walkthroughs with
            users who also evaluated the prototype through the System Usability Scale (SUS) tool. <mark>We recruited 6
                participants who represented our user group and 3 other participants
                who were industry experts.</mark> The SUS consisted of a 10 item questionnaire with five response
            options; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. Indicated below are the final scores that we obtained
            from the users and participants.</p>

        <div class="row evaluation-number">
            <div class=" col-md-6 ">
                <h1>87.5<span>/100</span></h1>

            <div class=" col-md-6 ">
                <h1>82.5<span>/100</span></h1>
                <p>SUS Score from 3 Experts</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>A SUS score above 68 is considered above average and <mark>a SUS score above 80 is considered excellent
                in form and performance.</mark> Furthermore, we carried out Heuristic Evaluation with 3 experts from
            various business units within Square
            who were highly knowledgeable in usability principles. During this evaluation, issues were identified and
            each issue was rated on their severity ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 being very low severity and 4 being
            very high severity. Some of
            the major issues that were highlighted during the evaluation session are as follows.

        <p>Based on the feedback that we received, I designed the second iteration for both the merchant-facing and
            the customer-facing design before presenting our final deliverables to the product managers at Square.

        <h6>Take Away</h6>
        <p>Overall, I was very satisfied with the way this project turned out. We went above and beyond for coming
            up with a solution that works not only for the merchants but also their customers. Our design solution
            addresses the problem given to us
            while keeping the constraints given by Square into consideration. While the customer-facing solution
            seems to be difficult to implement in the real world at the moment, <mark>it is only a matter of time
                before interactive messaging becomes a
                commonplace feature on these platforms.</mark></p>
