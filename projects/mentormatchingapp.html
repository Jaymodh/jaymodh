                and second year Master's students at Georgia Tech. Insightful data from some of the questions in the survey is shown below.

            <p>A list of sample questions from the interview have been included below. Depending on whether the participant was a mentor or a mentee, the questions were framed accordingly</p>

            <h6>Ideation</h6>
            <h6><span>Brainstorming</span></h6>
            <p>Adressing the needs of the user, I had to <mark>design a solution that provides two-way connection
                    opportunities to mentors as well as mentees and for mentors to connect with mentees without first
                    come first serve basis.</mark> While meeting this requirement, I also had to keep in consideration that <mark>mentees prefer to have only one mentor
                    and mentors may have a few (2-3) mentees.</mark> <br><br> Keeping the users anonymous would help me achieve this goal. <br><br> Hence,
                <mark>using anonymity as a central theme in the solution, I began to sketch a few wireframes that would
                    help me imagine the user flow.</mark>
            </p>

            <img src="../assets/images/googlesketch.jpg" class="googlesketch">

            <h6>Design</h6>
            <p>With the concept developed, I designed the flow of the app to visualize how mentors and mentees would use the app, both for connecting with each other and on a regular basis.</p>

            <h6><span>Wireframe Design</span></h6>
            <p>After deciding the stages the user goes through, I designed the wireframe for each stage of the app.
                <mark>The wireframes below are the final iteration and are designed from a mentor's perspective.</mark>
            </p>

        <div class="container container-custom">
            <h6><span>Feedback and Iteration</span></h6>
            <p>After designing the wireframe, <mark>I received feedback from three users (2 mentors, 1
                    mentee).</mark><br><br><b>1.</b> Initially, the design allowed the user to fill the anonymous form after the onboarding process. However, the user may not fill the form and would be left out of the discovery experience. As a result,
                it was necessary to include the filling of the form process in the onboarding process.</p>
            <img class="google-low-fi" src="../assets/images/googlechangeonboard.jpg">
            <p><b>2.</b> Though the users realised that having the feature to save an anonymous profile to review it later is important, clarification was needed. The "Save forLater" Button was thus replaced by a bookmark icon button.</p>
            <img class="google-low-fi" src="../assets/images/googlechangebookmark.jpg">
            <p><b>3.</b> Finally, I made changes to the profile section to make sure the disclaimer of anonymity does not make user feel ambigious about what information is visible and what isn't.</p>
            <img class="google-low-fi" src="../assets/images/googlechangeprofile.jpg">

            <h6><span>High-Fidelity Design</span></h6>
            <p>Finally, after I was satisfied the iterated wireframes, I began designing the high-fidelity version of the app.<br><br> While designing the visuals for the UI, I kept the design mostly white with a few elements that used primary and secondary
                colors, the main color being
                <span class="googleprimaryblue"><b>blue (#4285f4)</b></span>. The font I used in the design is
                <b>Roboto</b>.</p>

            <img class="google-high-fi" src="../assets/images/googlehiforumprofile.jpg">

            <h6 class="google-future">Future Scope</h6>
            <p>Coming up with designing solution for this prompt was definitely fun! <br><br>Through this design challenge, I explored how mentors and mentees can be anonymously paired with each other. Allowing two-way connection instead the one-way approach
                commonly used in pairing was challenging because even with two-way connection, mentees still had to be paired with one mentor at the end. I tried to solve this challenge by limiting the requests a mentee can recieve and by imposing a limit
                on the number of mentees a mentor can have. However, further work is required to make the pairing process more effecient. <br><br> Furthermore, this design focused on providing solution for mentors and mentees to discover and connect with
                each other. Fututre work could like into aspects of how, after pairing up, the mentor-mentee relationship can be maintained and strengthened as time progresses.</p>
