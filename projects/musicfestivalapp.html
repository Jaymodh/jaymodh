        <h6>Design Opportunity</h6>
        <p>Millions of people attend music festivals such as Coachella in California. These festivals span multiple
            days where multiple artists perform at the same time. <mark>Design an experience that will help people
                coordinate with their friends on which shows to attend and how to find each other in the crowds
                during the festival.</mark>

            <div class="note-content">
                People typically attend these festivals with 5 to 20+ friends. As group size grows, so does
                complexity with coordinating. Because there are multiple artists performing at the same time, the
                group of friends will often split to see different shows then
                try to reconvene at another show later making it difficult to find others in crowds as large as
                100,000 people.

        <h6><span>Competitive Analysis</span></h6>
        <p>To understand existing work in this field, I looked at two UX case studies on locating friends at a music
            festival.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/images/roadie_case1.jpg" class="roadie_max">
        <p class="casestudy"><i>Source:
                <a href="http://www.jasonspielman.com/SquadApp.html" target="_blank">Squad app</a>
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>In this case study, the author proposes the solution to use a P2P (Peer to Peer) network that
            <mark>allows users to keep track of their friends location without being connected to the internet which
                helps save the phone's battery.</mark> The author researched batterylife of Bluetooth vs GPS and
            found that Bluetooth uses less energy than GPS which is an important consideration when trying to save
            battery. However,
            this case study stood out to me for a different reason - the concerns regarding the sharing of location
            regularly. <mark>I believe continuous sharing of location
                with friends (or strangers you just met through your friends) can be dangerous and worrisome for
                many users.</mark> The design should allow users to share location only when requested and in a
            controlled manner.
        </p>

                    target="_blank">How to find your friends at a music festival</a>
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>In this case study, the author proposes <mark>an analog reference system that gives friends a context to
                their location.</mark> In his solution, the author suggests stage area labelled with large letters
            fashioned across the top of the stage, and numbered flags strung over both sides of the crowd. This
            would create a grid making it easier for users to locate each other. However, this solution does not work
            beyond a certain extent. In
            extremely crowded concert area, viewing these analog numbers is nearly impossible. Besides this concert
            areas come in all shapes and sizes which would not allow to implement a rectangular grid. There needs to be
            a more smarter way to implement
            this which is effortless to use. <mark>While there are limitations to this grid approach, it highlights the
                importance of locating users within extremely close proximity and crowded areas.</mark></p>
