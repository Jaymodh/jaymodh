        <!-- <h6 class="variant">About Roadie</h6>
        <p class="variant">Roadie is the first “on-the-way” delivery service that connects individuals and
            businesses looking to send same-day deliveries with drivers heading in the right direction. With a
            community of 150,000 verified drivers across more than 11,000
            cities and towns, Roadie has the largest local same-day delivery footprint in the country.
        </p> -->

        <h6 class="variant">My Role</h6>
        <p class="variant">At Roadie, I redesigned their delivery tracking interface for an improved sender experience
            which was shipped within 4 weeks. I also designed a new onboarding experience of their driver app and worked
            on the Content Management tool that helps expedite the publishing of new business articles. I took UX
            Research initiative to design and deploy surveys to understand market opportunities for their new payment
            feature and determined 45% user engagement.

        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>As a UX Design Intern, I worked on some of the most exciting projects that gave me the opportunity to put
            my design skills to practice and <mark>create a lasting impact on hundreds of thousands of users that
                use Roadie.</mark> A few of the projects that I worked on at Roadie have been discussed below.
        </p>

        <h6><span>#01 Delivery Tracking Interface Redesign</span></h6>
        <p>Taking initiative, one of the first projects that I worked on was improving the sender experience when
            they have created a gig. <mark>I evaluated the existing design of the delivery page and found the
                following design issues.</mark></p>

        <img src="../assets/images/Roadie_Delivery_Current.jpg" class="roadie-image-max">

        <p>Firstly, <mark>the interface lacked a status tracking sequence</mark> that shows the sender not only the
            previously completed states but also the ongoing states and the expected states for a delivery to be
            marked completed. For this, <mark>I designed
                multiple versions of the sequence</mark> and finalized one. <mark>For the selected sequence, I
                designed the various state as the delivery progressed</mark> from scheduling a pickup to completion.
            I also designed for the edge cases if the delivery wasn’t able to go through.
        </p>

        <img src="../assets/images/Roadie_Delivery_Status.jpg" class="roadie-image-max">

        <p>Incorporating the new status sequence, reorganizing the various sections and making a few design changes,
            <mark>I designed the new interface for the deliverage page.</mark></p>

        <img src="../assets/images/Roadie_Delivery_Redesign.jpg" class="roadie-image-max">

        <p>After getting the design approval from various teams, <mark>I worked closely with the Development team
                and the Quality Assurance team to help ship the interface.</mark></p>

        <p class="section-divider">

        </p>

        <h6><span>#02 Content Management Tool Design</span></h6>
        <p>The marketing team at Roadie release new articles, update information, help guides and promotions on the
            Roadie platform for both senders and drivers. For this, <mark>the marketing team would reach out to the
                UX team and the Dev team to help implement
                it</mark> on their interface. <mark>Giving them the ability to function independently, I designed
                the Content Management tool for the Marketing team</mark> by building up on their existing design.
        </p>

        <h6><span>#03 Driver Onborading Experience Design</span></h6>
        <p>Towards the end of my internship, I focused on redesigning the onboarding experience of Roadie drivers.
            For this project, I started off by doing a competitor analysis to see what the onboarding experience
            looks like on other platforms. <mark>I designed
                the user flow for the new onboarding experience and designed high-fidelity interface for their
                mobile app</mark>. Currently, this project is under development. If you would like to see the
            Interface design, please reach out to me.</p>

        <h6>Take Away</h6>
        <p>As I look back at my internship experience at Roadie, I think of all the positive moments that I gained
            in this short amount of time. I got to work along side some of the most talented individuals in this
            industry. I’m thankful to them for
            trusting me with my design skills and giving me the opportunity to work on projects that were directly
            deployed into the real world. I learned to trust my design decisions. I realized I value feedback and
            actively seek it. I took initiatives
            and tried to make the most out of this internship experience. I collaborated with numerous teams at
            various stages of design and development. However, it was this message shared by the Product Lead of the
            company, that was the highlight
            of my 3 month long internship.</p>

        <p>I will cherish this and all my other wonderful experiences at Roadie forever.</p>
